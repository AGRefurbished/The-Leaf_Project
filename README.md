## 🌍 Why This Matters: AI's Environmental Impact

While AI offers powerful capabilities, its rapid expansion comes at a significant environmental cost:

### ⚡ Energy Consumption
Training large language models can consume hundreds of megawatt-hours — equivalent to the annual energy use of over 100 U.S. homes.

### ☁️ Carbon Emissions
Data centers that power AI models release substantial CO₂ emissions, especially when powered by fossil fuels.

### ⛏️ Hardware Mining
GPUs and TPUs require rare earth metals like lithium and cobalt, which involve environmentally damaging mining and often unethical labor practices.

### ♻️ E-Waste
AI accelerates the production of short-lifecycle hardware, contributing to mounting electronic waste with limited recycling options.

### 💧 Water Usage
Millions of gallons of water are used annually to cool AI data centers, stressing water supplies in drought-prone areas.

**The Leaf Project** addresses these challenges by offering a low-tech, scalable cooling solution that mimics nature’s water cycle.  
It’s a step toward truly sustainable and regenerative AI infrastructure.

### Key Features Illustrated:

- **Steam inlet** at the base, funneling heated vapor upward  
- **Angled synthetic leaves** capture and condense water vapor  
- **Gravity-assisted dripping** collects clean water in a central column or reservoir  
- **Air pressure relief valve** at the top to prevent overpressure and ensure safety
